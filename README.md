To run the Python files you will need [Face_Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) and [OpenCV](https://bit.ly/2ERAIBJ) installed. I have only tried it on ubuntu 16.04 but should work on any linux distro with python. It might also work on windows but I am not sure what work arounds would need to be done. You can create an ubuntu VM or downlaod the [premade one](https://bit.ly/2qpmX5Q)

Run real_time.py to start the program:

``
python real_time.py
``

OpenCV is only needed for the realtime video,face_forward can be done on a premade image and later applied to the frames of the video
